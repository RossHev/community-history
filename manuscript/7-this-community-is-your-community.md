# This Community is Your Community
The DevOps Collective and PowerShell.org were always created to be a place that serves the needs of the community. That serves _your_ needs. Its founders have taken some guesses as to what those needs might be; sometimes we got it right, and other times we didn't. But we've kept plugging away.

Don't look at the organization today and think, "well, all the jobs are being done." They aren't. There are probably needs we've never thought of; reach out and propose that we try them, and volunteer to lead the effort.

Volunteer to "shadow" an existing team member. CEO, CFO, Summit Logistics, Summit Content, Webmaster, Forums Moderator, ICYMI Editor, Social Media Manager--you name it, every one of these roles will eventually have to pass on to someone else, so it's never too early for the current team to start training their backup, or their own successors. I don't know that "too much help" is a thing. We'll eventually need someone to deal with scholarship applications and manage the selection process. We'll need new teachers for the entry-level OnRamp track at Summit. 

There's always going to be room for more people to contribute. And we all want you to. Even people you've never met, and may never meet, can benefit from what you have to offer--even if *you* think you have nothing to offer.

This is _your_ community. Those of us who've founded it and kept it going so far are doing it _for_ you, because we sure ain't getting paid. If it's helped you, then consider joining us.
