# Handoff
Going into it in 2012, at least one of us was already approaching retirement age. A couple of us weren't far off. One of us seemed to be defying death simply by waking up every morning (kidding). Point is, by 2018 we'd been at it for 6 years, and it was time to start making sure it could outlive us.

Preparing to step away from something you helped create is enormously emotional. It's like sending your kid to college, where other people are going to start having more of an impact on them than you do. But it's also rewarding: having the confidence that your precious child will be just fine is a huge feel-good.

Today, most of the PowerShell.org "old guard" have stepped back. We're still very much around when questions arise or when help is needed, but there's a brand-new DevOps Collective team in place. We've a new CEO, a new CFO, and an apprentice event manager for Summit. There's a new Content team for Summit. We've pulled in a social media manager, and a team to monitor the Q&A forums on the site. We have a team working on "In Case You Missed It" weekly news roundups, which is helping drive more attention to the organizational Twitter feed--an important tool for marketing Summit. We've still some roles to fill, but we're actively doing that. And we're still spinning up new projects, like Summit's OnRamp track and scholarship, and as we operationalize those we'll work to hand them off as well.

As an organization based almost wholly on unpaid labor (our CEO now receives a small monthly contract fee, helping ensure his time can be set aside for the organization), handoff is crucial. We've needed to find people who are interested in helping, find areas where their existing skills can create a positive impact, and help keep them motivated.

We've developed a recognition program in the form of a Challenge Coin for individuals who've made a multi-year contribution to the community, and currently only five of those have been awarded. We're working on a middle-tier recognition program so that the people currently involved in keeping our community running can be recognized and appreciated for their work. We feel this is an important aspect of volunteerism: helping run something like The DevOps Collective is, these days, a serious boost on your resume if nothing else, so we want to enable that.

As the old guard has stepped back, we've asked our replacements to document what they do. When they ask a question, we answer, and they document it. This is creating an "Operating Manual" for the organization, something that can grow, evolve, and be refined over time, and hopefully make it easier for an eventual "3rd generation" to take over.

And that's the key: we're trying to plan for the _next_ generation of community leaders, and the one after that. Because although this is a story about a community, _people_ comprise that community. _You_ are part of the community. It's not owned by the people who most visibly got it going; it's owned by _you_.
