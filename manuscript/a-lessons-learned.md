# Appendix A: Lessons Learned
This is intended to help sum-up some of what we've learned over the past years.

**Communities might not take a lot of time, but they need constant doses of attention.** Especially in its formative years, a community needs unwavering love, often from a small group of dedicated individuals. Even taking a week off to go on vacation can set you back months, so teamwork and real dedication is critical. Again, **communities need a little bit of your time, every day, or they'll wither.**

**Communities need to exist for their own reasons; commercial concerns will always, eventually, get distracted or change directions.** It's not impossible for corporations to create effective communities--Spiceworks being a notable one--but that kind of long-term, executive-level commitment is rare. The most effective communities happen because there's a need for them, and a supply of dedicated volunteers to make them happen.

**Not everyone who contributes meaningfully to a community is going to do so in the same way.** When you have a volunteer who wants to contribute, you can't necessarily just set them onto your most urgent need. You have to find a way for them to contribute, _meaningfully_, that fits their own passions, their own interests, and their own abilities. This is one of the most key aspects of running a community. Along with this is, **activate volunteers and work to keep them engaged.**

**Communities work when they're responsive.** A website that just publishes articles might be incredibly useful, but it's not a community. Communities are interactive, facilitating engagements between human beings. And the best communities get those interactions going _quickly_, so that the community feels alive and vibrant. This can mean a ton of work, in the early days, for the organizations. While "if you build it, they will come" is true, it's more like, "if you build it, and basically run it yourself, and really work to involve others, then eventually, they will come."

**Don't be afraid to try new things, and stop doing them if they're not working.** You can't always tell what will be a "hit" within a community, so try new stuff. Look for needs, and see if you can fill them. But always go at it from that direction: state the _need_ you believe you're filling, point to some evidence that _it is a need_, and then work to solve it.

**Document everything you do, even your bumps and failures.** Keep a journal, if nothing else; it'll facilitate involving others, and eventually let you step back, leaving something wonderful and self-sustaining behind.
