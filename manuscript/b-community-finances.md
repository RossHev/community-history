# Appendix B: Community Finances
We're sometimes asked about the money it takes to run the organization. Here are some numbers from our 2019 budget.

Our non-Summit expenses include:
* About $360 for Office 365
* About $480 for Quickbooks
* About $5,000 for AWS (this is mainly the public build server, which we're transitioning to Azure as I write this; Azure offers nonprofit credits which will lower costs)
* About $1,800 for Wordpress hosting
* $40,000 in contract fees to our current CEO
* About $4,000 for accounting and bookkeeping
* About $500 in state licenses
* About $40,000 for Summit scholarships (that's basically T&E for ten people, plus their admission)

We donate $50,000 annually to TechImpact to support their IT Works program, which provides entry-level IT Operations education to young people from underrepresented groups and disadvantaged situations.

Summit represents our major expenses:

* We budget about $3,500 for our event manager's time, travel, and expenses; this has traditionally been a professional from outside the community since it's a very specialized job. As this transitions to an in-community person (which it is), this'll likely go down, but we may leave it as a budget item as a hedge against future need.
* We pay about $1,000 for event insurance. We have to carry a $5M general liability policy.
* We budget about $35,000 for speaker fees (and we do not pay T&E for speakers, although they do get free admission, so there are some hard costs, like food and beverage, associated with each speaker)
* Our registration and scheduling services run about $2,500
* Badges and lanyards cost about $5 per attendee
* We budget about $5 per attendee for swag (like a shirt or notebook)
* General printing is about $2,000
* Our collectible one-inch round annual buttons are about $.50 per person
* We budget about $10,000 for entertainment for our Monday evening recpetion
* We budget about $520 per person for food and beverage. 
* Our audiovisual bill is around $50,000, and our Internet around $7,500. Session recording services run about $35,000.
* Sales tax and service fees come to about $160 per attendee, plus an additional $5,750 on audiovisual and Internet.

All told, for a 410-person event (which includes speakers, Microsoft team members, and scholarship recipients), we earn about $580,000 and spend about $565,000 for the entire organization, for the entire year. 

We budget a bit extra for our Directors' travel, and to host a pre-show planning meeting the day before Summit. This adds up to about $8,000 total, and when our Directors give a presentation they don't receive a speaker fee. We felt covering hotel and coach airfare was a reasonable exchange for all these people do during the year (as volunteers) to make Summit, and the organization in general happen. 

Summit sponsorships aren't something we rely on, so they're not in the budget. We also don't rely on charitable donations, but they do come in. For example, for 2018-2019, half of our scholarship budget ($40,000) came in from sponsors or donations, saving us about $20,000. There's also a certain amount of rounding-up-for-error in the budget numbers, which often means there's a bit extra at the end of the year, which is fine. If the "margin of error" accumulates to a significant amount in the bank account, we divert it to more scholarships or to TechImpact, generally. Our current CFO has also been crushing it in terms of switching us to free or less-expensive nonprofit services, like Office 365 and Quickbooks, and that'll have a positive impact over the long haul. If we're able to consistently reduce our expenses, we'll lower Summit admission prices in response.

One reason we decided to implement a $40,000 fee for the CEO was to ensure that person could take the time to run the organization. Our current CEO does that in an agreement with his employer, effectively working part-time for them and for us. 

Food and beverage pricing is actually our biggest variable, and you'll notice that food and beverage is expensive. $520 per person--plus 20% service charges and almost 10% tax, which applies to the service charge--has to cover four breakfasts, four lunches, midday snacks, and two evening events. Per-meal, per-person, that's less than $52, and in the conference biz that doesn't go far. We've been fortunate in that our event venue in Washington is run by a nonprofit, and they extend nonprofit pricing to us. By agreeing to be on the hook for 200 hotel rooms during the event, we're able to secure 2- and 3-year contracts with fixed pricing, which helps tremendously. But if you're curious, consider that a gallon of coffee is over $50, plus service charge and tax. Running an event center is incredibly expensive, and food and beverage are the main way that recoup those costs (we don't, for example, pay rental fees on the space itself).

The cost of food and beverage is also why we steer clear of "piece goods" like hot breakfast sandwiches. If we order 410 sandwiches, rest assured our attendees will often double- or triple-up, meaning whoever's at the end of the buffet line will get nothing. "Why don't you just order more" isn't an option, as our budget only includes so many $13 sandwiches (plus tax and service fees). So we've moved almost entirely to "tray foods," which tend to get you more bang for your buck. Costs are also why we can't accommodate special diets beyond allergies and religious requirements; having a tray of low-carb, a tray of raw-Vegan, a tray of no-gluten, a tray ofâ€¦ well, you name it, it gets expensive. As-is, we _routinely_ have people who request a gluten-free meal because they're "sensitive," and then end up eating break from the main buffet anyway because it looks so enticing. That special meal costs us extra, and it goes to waste.

The hotel room blocks are another stressful point. We're on the hook for those rooms whether they're used or not, and plenty of people won't or can't stay in the hotel we choose (often due to their company rules). The room block represents a ~$150,000 expense, which is only reduced when people actually use the rooms. But without that room guarantee, we couldn't book our venue more than 6 months out, which makes for a very awkward planning situation if someone else books it away from us. Without people staying in the room block, we run a very real risk of bankrupting the organization in a single year. So it's a game of begging every time, to try and fill that block.

You'll also notice that provisioning Internet is pricey. That's another reality of conference centers, some of whom (not ours) also charge you for electricity _by the ampere_. That's why streaming sessions gets so expensive: you not only need to spend $35k (in our case) on cameras and capturing equipment, you gotta quadruple-down on the bandwidth you're paying for, all to accommodate an audience that isn't even paying to be at the event! When you see events like VMworld and Ignite doing that, it's because the companies' massive marketing budgets are shouldering the crippling expense. They're doing it to sell you product; our organization isn't.

So the next time you're at a conference and you're wondering why they just don't have free-flowing fountains of Coke and coffee everywhere, and free streams for every session, that's why. It's nuts-expensive.
